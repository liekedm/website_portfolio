                <p> 
I am Lieke de Mare, a first year graduate students Industrial design student at the Technical University of Eindhoven. Outside my studies I am active at the scouting, other hobbies include photography and tinkering.

I want to be the bridge between professional healthcare and regular people, to help fulfill peoples needs in an at home context. By designing data rich systems which have the user at its center.

Vision as designer

                    <p> 
I want to design smart personal systems that can be used in healthcare. The medical worlds is evolving and there are more and more ways to help people improve their quality of life, but sometimes it seems to me that the medical world only sees the broken bodies that need to be fixed. This results in great working therapies and procedures but which are not always perceived well by patients. In my opinion industrial design can be the bridge between the medical world and the patients. For example when looking at rehabilitation programs. Doctors provide exercises to patients, to improve after a medical procedure or physical problem, but for patients it might be hard to do these exercises correctly independently or to find the motivation. Products can be designed to provide motivation, make rehabilitation more fun or provide tools to make the exercises easier to perform at home. To do this, I think it is very important to take human factors into account and to properly deal with the physical and cognitive aspects of humans. Customizable systems also seem very important for efficient care. Everyone is different, in the medical world patients can for example differ greatly in severity of disability, but there are also differences in motivation and need for cognition. It seems important that the system deals with these differences. By properly using the data that is collected the system can learn more about the user and provide suitable output.

Identity as designer
                    </h2>
                    <p> 
Although I want to design with human factors taken into account I don’t see myself completely user focused, because in case of design in healthcare there are many standpoints to deal with. Products need to be viable, this means they should be effective, which could lead into decisions having to be made that might not be in line with the wishes of the user. Research is very important to me while I see the necessity of it to make a great viable design. In healthcare you can not only listen to the wishes of the user, you need to know some of the medical background. Also research and benchmarking helps to understand what is already known to avoid making mistakes that have already been made, what does work and what doesn’t work and it can give information I couldn’t get myself due to privacy or ethical considerations.
