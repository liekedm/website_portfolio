                    Arthritis is an illness which causes inflammation and pain in the joints. It can limit flexibility and make moving painful. A common therapy is hand exercises and wearing gloves, to keep the joint warm and flexible. To improve the self-management of health, a system was created to remind users in doing their hand exercises and to guide them through the process. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Arli is a new kind of arthritis glove which uses small integrated colored LEDs to provide the information about the hand exercises. Every light represents a certain joint or joint combination and can use color to show if the joint needs to be bend or stretched. Different exercises can be shows due to different color combinations. The lights would also provide notifications to show the user when it has been more than 24, 36 or 48 hours since the last exercises has been done, as a reminder and stimulation to do the exercises frequently. Integrating the system in the gloves enables the users to use the system at all times, at any location.
