            <h1>Wrist brace</h1>
                <p>
                    3D printed braces are already done on the market in small scale, with potential to go bigger. This is while there are many advantages of 3D printed braces or casts. They can be made using 3D scans and are therefore individual and well fitting. 3D printed casts can also have a more open structure than what is seen with plaster casts, giving room for scratching and cleaning. This project is an example of such a 3D printed brace, in which I used a Voronoi pattern. The brace is made out of two sides to make it easy to put on without the need of bending or twisting the wrist. One side is closed by elastics, this side also works as a hinges when opening the brace. The other side is closed by sliders.
