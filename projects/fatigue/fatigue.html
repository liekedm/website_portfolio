            <h1>Recognizing fatigue using wearable sensors and machine learning</h1>
                <p>
                    Fatigue has influence on the performance of people. In healthcare workers, who are shown to be susceptible to fatigue, this can have consequences for patient safety. Therefor it is beneficial to be able to identify fatigue in the work environment. Wearables provide a non-intrusive option for continuous monitoring of healthcare workers and as relationships have been found between fatigue and walking gait, predicting fatigue based on walking data was seen as a possibility. This was tested using two accelerometers, one placed on the heel of the foot and one placed on the lower back. Walking data was collected of peoples before and after a fatigue inducing activity. These measurements were used as input in a machine learning model which was tested to predict the fatigue state of participants step features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For binary fatigue classification the support vector machine, machine learning models, using either sensor information from the foot and lower back, or the sensor information from one of the sensors separately, show mean and median accuracy higher than the guess average of 50 percent. This shows that there is potential in predicting when someone is slightly fatigued using wearable accelerometers/gyroscopes, worn on the foot and the lower back. As the results of the models, containing either features from both sensors or just using a single sensor seperately, lay close together, it also shows that there is a possibility of using just one sensor instead of two, which would be beneficial for cost- and use efficiency. Which of the sensors can be used best would require further research and would depend on the requirements of the user, if a higher mean accuracy is desirable or less variance.
