                    For some children, making social contact is hard. The game MyZoo is inspired on PokemonGo. It is a stand-alone device which lets children collect zoo animals by locking fingerprints with new people. When a new fingerprint is scanned, a new animal will appear in the virtual zoo. This way, children are rewarded for making social contacts. This stimulates the social-emotional development and helps them further in life. While order is important for autistic children it is important to integrate the product into the normal life of the child, this can be done with simple actions like feeding the animals every day.

                    The design has a fun childish color and can be easily hold by the handle on the top. Rubber parts provide good grip to prevent dropping. The zoo theme was chosen to match the interest of both boys and girls.
